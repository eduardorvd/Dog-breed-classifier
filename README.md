## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
You should have installed Anaconda and Tensorflow in your local machine to follow the steps in this notebook.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. To run the step 5 in the notebook, you need to download the ResNet-50 bottleneck features in the link: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The goal of this project is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. Is is one of the possible projects to implement as the last project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree. 
In this notebook, it was created an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook named 'dog app.ipynb' available in this github contains all the steps developed to predicts the dogs breed based on the images. There is also a folder named images that contains the images used to validate the algorithms predictions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://eduardorvduarte.medium.com/using-data-science-to-understand-the-price-gap-of-airbnb-accommodations-in-rio-de-janeiro-33058a86c15f).
